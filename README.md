  Hey Anna - First of all wanted to let you know I wasn't able to get to work on this today, I had a Kappa thing come up that had to be dealt with, which ate some good time away. I do feel horrible about not being able to work on this as much as I want to right now. I hate that person in group projects and never want to be that person EVER. I'm going to keep watching some of the discussion videos tomorrow to get on track with this and make sure I have everything I need to have installed for this to continue running smoothly.
  As far as the progress for this project goes, should we attempt making the table a priority? I know we have to do basic commands, but I assume those will all be included in this table we are supposed to construct. Let me know your thoughts on this.
  My exam is Wednesday midday, I also have a paper due on Friday. Definitely this next weekend I will be GRINDING on this thing, I will not be having plans other than coding and this project!
  Thanks, Darbs
