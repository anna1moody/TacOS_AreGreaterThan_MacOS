# TacOS_AreGreaterThan_MacOS

Hey, Anna! I uploaded my work in the nutshell folder. The Makefile runs, so as long as you download that and run it in linux ($make, and run ./nutshell), you should be good to go to test out the functionality. So far I've tackled some of the built-in commands: setenv, printenv, unsetenv should work to their full extent. cd works (use a blank test directory to check and then printenv to see the updated working directory), but it's not fully tuned yet; neither is alias.
I think the next step is figuring out how to access the basic commands in linux (these are found in /bin in linux; eg. ls, mkdir). These are what we should make the table. There is a working table example in nutshell.c for reference on how that would look, but I think we should try and add as many of the basic commands as we can - it'll only help us. There are some notes on teams about it farther up, especially a post on 3/22 about it with a few responses from Neill and Michael. If we can get some of these working tomorrow, we will be in good shape.
